<p>I have been coding since I was in college, where I studied computer science and engineering at Savitribai Phule Pune University. I have learned many programming languages and technologies on my own, through online courses, books, blogs, and podcasts. I'm always curious and eager to learn new things and explore new possibilities.</p>
<p>My passion is to create and enhance anything related to technology. Whether it's a website, an app, a game, a chatbot, or a smart device, I enjoy the process of designing, developing, testing, and deploying it. I also like to experiment and research on emerging fields such as IoT, AI, machine learning, deep learning, big data, distributed computing, and parallel programming. I believe that these technologies have the potential to transform the world in positive ways.</p>
<p>I'm not only a coder but also an entrepreneur at heart. I have worked on several projects that aim to solve real-world problems using technology. I have learned a lot from these experiences, such as how to work in a team, how to communicate effectively, how to manage time and resources, how to deal with failures and setbacks, and how to keep improving and innovating.</p>
<p>I'm also a "jugaadu" kind of person. Jugaad is a Hindi word that means finding a low-cost and quick solution to a problem using whatever resources are available. It's a mindset of being resourceful, creative, and adaptable. So if you give me a challenge and a time limit to find a solution for it, and if I don't know anything about it, then I just need one machine and full access to the internet. I'll do research, learn, and develop the solution for that challenge within the given time frame.</p>
<p>Apart from technology and entrepreneurship, I also have other interests and hobbies. I like to read books on various topics such as psychology, philosophy, history, geography, science fiction, spirituality etc. I like to listen to music of different genres such as indian classical, old hindi and marathi songs etc. I like to travel to new places and experience different cultures and cuisines. I like to trek and hike in nature and enjoy the scenic views. I like to go on solo bike ride. I like to take photos of street scenes and landscapes with my camera or phone.</p>
<p>That's all about me for now. Thank you!ðŸ˜Š</p>
